### TODO
    I don't know how this is implemented,
    but I'm guessing this is how its done:


Each major coinholder has priv / pub key, with pub key as account number.


Transactions are passed around the network and spread like a fire, same as PoW.

The difference is, each major coinholder will accept (groups of) transactions on the ledger and sign them
with their private key. 
If a transaction is signed by the majority of coinholders, it is recognized as valid.

### TO-LEARN:
How are the transactions synchronized across blocks?
Is each individual transaction signed by the majority coinholders?





Each major coinholder is incentivized to cooperate with each other major coinholder,
because they want to keep the transactions legit, and encourage investors.
