Market-cap activated linear burn ratio: (MALBR)

A coefficient that adds burn rate when the market cap is low.
For example,  let   BR(M) be the burn ratio of the crypto, where M is the market cap,
and K is the target market cap:

BR(M) = max(0, 1 - M / K)

This provides a linear burn ratio from market cap 0 -> K.
When market cap is >= K, no burn is applied.
